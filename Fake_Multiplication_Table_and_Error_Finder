Python Problem 8: Fake Multiplication Tables | Python Tutorials For Absolute Beginners In Hindi #117
The task you have to perform is “Fake Multiplication Tables”. This task consists of a total of 15 points to evaluate your performance.

Problem Statement:-
 Rohan das is a fraud by nature. Rohan Das wrote a python function to print a multiplication table of a given number and put one of the values (randomly generated) as wrong.

Rohan Das did this to fool his classmates and make them commit a mistake in a test. You cannot tolerate this!

So you decided to use your python skills to counter Rohan’s actions by writing a python program that validates Rohan’s multiplication table.

Your function should be able to find out the wrong values in Rohan’s table and expose Rohan Das as a fraud.

Note: Rohan’s function returns a list of numbers like this

Rohan Das’s Function Input:
rohanMultiplication(6)

Rohan’s function returns this output:
[6, 12, 18, 26, …., 60]

You have to write a function isCorrect(table, number) and return the index where rohan’s function is wrong and print it to the screen! If the table is correct, your function returns None
